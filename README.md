# Quiz-App
Project which comes under Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Program

# Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. Itâ€™s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (We recommend about 5-10 quiz questions for a reasonable scope of your app).

# What will I learn?
-Planning your app design before coding.
-Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
-Creating, positioning, and styling views.
-Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
-Commenting and documenting your code.
